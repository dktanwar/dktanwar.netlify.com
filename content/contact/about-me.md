Coming from an Army background, I had priviledge to live across India (Dibrugarh, Jammu, Lucknow, Pune, Agartala, Chandigarh, Jaipur). I have grown up learning different languages and cultures. I was always interested in the interface of biology and computer science, and then I discovered Bioiformatics. I enjoy being a bioinformatician, playing around with genetic code using computer.

I was always amazed by the research done in Germany, which landed me there for my bachelors thesis. During my thesis, I analyzed Microarray data from Sepsis paitents. Being new to programming in R, applying statistics, and genomics data, everthing was too challenging for me. But, it developed a strong interest in me for analyzing and interpreting biological data.

After finishing my bachelors thesis, I started looking for a job, and found one at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, USA. While ay UAB, I became an avid user of the statistical programming language R, using it to process, visualize, model and report our data. I also started contributing to open source packages on GitHub.

I started building my interest in epigenetics and sounded an interesting topic for research. To work in epigenetics and to pursue my further education, Master, I moved to Montréal, Canada. There, I worked on building an interactive ChIP-Seq data analysis platform.

After my Masters, I moved to Zürich, Switzerland to pursue my PhD at ETH Zürich. Here, I am working with several datasets from a number of *omics techniques. Also, I am developing tools to analyze short RNA-Seq data and working on benchmarking tools for methylation data analysis.

In my free time, I work for myself, roam around Switzerland, listen to songs, and watch movies. Also, I love cooking, as much as I love food!
