I am a Scientific Assistant and a PhD student in the [Neuroepigenetics, lab of Prof. Isabelle Mansuy](https://www.hifo.uzh.ch/en/research/mansuy) at [University of Zürich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html) and [Swiss Federal Institute of Technology](https://ethz.ch/en.html).

I use my knowledge of R, Bash scripting, Perl and other languages to analyze data from genomics and epigenomics experiments, and develop tools for their analysis.

My background is in bioinformatics and epigenetics. I did my bachelors in technology (engineering) (B.Tech.) in Bioinformatics from [Amity University Rajasthan](https://www.amity.edu/jaipur/about-amity-jaipur), India. For my undergrad thesis, I worked under [Prof. Rainer König](https://www.leibniz-hki.de/en/institut-staff-details.html?member=75) at [University of Jena](https://www.uni-jena.de/en/), Germany. Then, I moved to the USA to work at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. I was a masters student in the [Lab of Prof. Sarah Kimmins](https://www.mcgill.ca/animal/staff/kimmins) and in the [Lab of Prof. Jianguo Xia](http://www.xialab.ca/).
